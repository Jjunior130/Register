Register
========

Represent Register behaviors in ruby code (To write down the logic in ruby code of a better register system design)

Hopefully this serves as a reference ruby code sample or something similar for other nuby(s) like my self.

gems so far used:
  pry (better than IRB)
  rubocop (for good ruby grammar)
